Every time we lie awake. 
After every hit we take. 
Every feeling that I get, 
but I haven't missed you yet. 
Every roommate kept awake, by every sigh and skrim we make. 
All the feelings that I get, but I still don't miss you yet

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
